# About me

I am a PhD student funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) and hosted at the [GestaltReVision Lab](http://gestaltrevision.be/en/) at KU Leuven, Belgium. Under supervision of [prof. Johan Wagemans](http://gestaltrevision.be/en/about-us/principal-investigator), I study image memorability.


In my PhD project, I aim to contribute to the understanding of what makes an image memorable by focusing on the more intermediate levels of the visual hierarchy, as opposed to, for example, more high-level semantic content (i.e., the "how" of depicting, rather than the "what"). The working hypothesis is that the variability in image memorability partly resides in how easy it is to organize an image visually. We outlined two approaches to evaluate this hypothesis. One is to investigate the relationship between memorability and other tasks that are dependent on easy perceptual organization. Another approach is to actually identify specific, computable mid-level features underlying memorability. These would be features facilitating a quick extraction of a structural description of the image while keeping it distinctive.
