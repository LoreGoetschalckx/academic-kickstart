# About me

How does the mind process information? What is intelligence? How do we form memories? These are questions that I have always found intriguing and that motivated me to study psychology and cognitive science. Through my PhD work, I also a grew a profound curiosity for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm convinced that the cross-fertilization between the fields of cognitive science and computer science lead to deeper insights in both fields.

My PhD work was funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) and largely carried out at the [GestaltReVision Lab](http://gestaltrevision.be/en/) at KU Leuven, Belgium, advised by [prof. Johan Wagemans](http://gestaltrevision.be/en/about-us/principal-investigator). In addition, I spent 8 months at CSAIL, MIT conducting research as a visiting student, advised by [prof. Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/) and [prof. Aude Oliva](http://olivalab.mit.edu/). In my PhD project, I aimed to contribute to the understanding of what makes an image memorable by focusing on the more intermediate levels of the visual hierarchy, as opposed to, for example, more high-level semantic content (i.e., the "how" of depicting, rather than the "what").
